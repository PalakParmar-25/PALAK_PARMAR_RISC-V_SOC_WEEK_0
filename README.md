# 🌟 Open-Source Silicon Journey – RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program  

I’m currently participating in the **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program**, organized by **VLSI System Design (VSD)** in collaboration with **IIT Gandhinagar**.  
This program is India’s **largest collaborative silicon design initiative**, where we learn how to design a **System-on-Chip (SoC)** from **RTL → GDSII** using **open-source EDA tools**.  

With **3500+ participants**, it’s helping build a strong foundation for India’s **semiconductor ecosystem**.

## 🎓 Program Highlights  
- Learn the complete SoC design workflow with open-source tools.  
- Top 50 students will:  
  - Work under **IIT Gandhinagar professors**.  
  - Gain access to **Synopsys industry-grade tools**.  

---

## 🛠️ Week 0 – Setup & Tools  
- Installed **Ubuntu 20.04+ VM** on Oracle VirtualBox.  
- Set up and tested tools:  
  - **Yosys** - Synthesis  
  - **Icarus Verilog (Iverilog)** - Simulation  
  - **GTKWave** - Waveform analysis  
- Ran basic design flow to verify environment.  

✅ **Outcome**: Toolchain successfully installed and ready for SoC design journey.
